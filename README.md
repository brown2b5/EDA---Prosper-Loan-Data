# Exploratory Data Analysis - Prosper Loan Data
Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the United States which provides a platform for borrowers and lenders (1).  Borrowers can apply for a fixed-rate, fixed-term loan of between $2,000 and $35,000 and individuals/institutions can invest in loans which generate attractive returns (1).  Data is available on Prosper loans (2).  This data includes interest rates, borrower employment status, borrower income, loan amount, borrower credit history and many other variables (3).  The purpose of this project is to explore the data to determine which conditions might be used to predict whether a borrower will be successful in paying back the original loan amount and interest.  I expect to see which borrower incomes, employment status, credit history and other variables are most associated with those who default on their loans and who successfully complete their loan payments.
